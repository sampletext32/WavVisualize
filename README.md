# WavVisualize
![CI](https://github.com/sampletext32/WavVisualize/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is my project about investigating audio playback and realtime analysis.

It currently relies on [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) Ð¸ [NAudio.Lame](https://github.com/Corey-M/NAudio.Lame) for playback.

[VkNet.AudioBypass](https://github.com/shelln1ght/VkNet.AudioBypass) gives the ability to download audio with [VkNet](https://github.com/vknet/vk) - an unofficial VK API lib.
